% Vectorized simulation of the SNN
% 
% Input: 
%       spikes : input spikes, binary matrix (n x end_time)
%       weights : the weight matrix (m x n), the row represents the output (m), 
%       col represents input (n)
%       self_weights : weight matrix (m x m) models the recurrent connectivity
%       vth : the threshold voltage
%       tm : the time constants of vmem
%       ts : the time constant of the synaptic response
%
% Output: 
%       vmem : matrix of vmem (m x end_time)
%       o_spikes : output spike matrix (m x end_time)
%       num_o_spikes : vector of output spikes (m x 1)
%       A_k : the variable to keep track of accumulative effect (m x 1)
%       h : the weighted spikes sum (m x 1)
%       a_k : the break down effect of each synapse (m x n) or 
%       (m x (n + m)) if self_weight is not empty
